# assignment_sorter
Extracts and sorts downloaded DSA scala packages into corresponding folders

Just place the downloaded .zip files into the same directory as folders.sh and run it with `sh folders.sh`.
folders.sh unzips the files, cleans up the folder names and sorts them into directories according to their numbering.

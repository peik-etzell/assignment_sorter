Extracts and sorts downloaded DSA scala packages into corresponding folders

Just place the downloaded .zip files into the same directory as folders.sh and run it with `sh folders.sh`.
folders.sh unzips the files, cleans up the folder names and sorts them into directories according to their numbering. 

Hardcoded for the scala2 versions, but can probably be edited to do the same for the scala3 packages with a quick edit on line 11.
